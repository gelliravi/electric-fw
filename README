electric-fw is a Python set of modules for complex event processing.

==linkedevents.py==

Allows defining 1 to N associated events. The module defines the class LinkedEvent, featuring the same threading.Event methods (see Python docs). However, some of this methods present additional behavior:

- set() : sets the current event and also all the linked events.
- clear() : clear the current and linked events.

This behaviour is not bidirectional. That is, setting or clearing the linked events will not set the current event.

The class offers two additional methods:

- add_link( event ) : links on event to the current LinkedEvent instance.
- remove_link( event ) : unlinks the event from the current instance.
