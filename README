electric-fw is a Python set of modules for complex event processing.

==electric.LinkedEvent== 

This abstract class features the same threading. Event methods (see Python docs). It also offers two additional methods:

- add_link( event ) : links on event to the current BranchEvent instance.
- remove_link( event ) : unlinks the event from the current instance.

==electric.BranchEvent==

Allows defining 1 to N associated events. Redefines the parent LinkedEvent methos in order to present additional behavior:

- set() : sets the current event and also all the linked events.
- clear() : clear the current and linked events.

This behavior is not bidirectional. That is, setting or clearing the linked events will not set the current event.

The class offers two additional methods:

- add_link( event ) : links on event to the current BranchEvent instance.
- remove_link( event ) : unlinks the event from the current instance.

==electric.HubEvent==

Allow defining N to 1 associated events. Some of its methods present additional behavior:

- set() : check the linked events and set the current event depending on the state of them.
- clear() : check the linked events and clear the current event depending on the state of them.

There are two implementations of the Hub event: AND and OR. They behave when setting and clearing like the AND and OR logic functions being set=0, clear=0, and input=linked events and output=this event.

This behavior is not bidirectional. That is, setting or clearing the current event will not set or clear the linked events.

Additionally, when adding a link, the class checks that it belongs to the BranchEvent class. This is needed to perform the connection between the linked event and the current event when setting and clearing.
